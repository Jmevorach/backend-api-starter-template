## Why ADRs

ADRs make important decisions explicit:

- Preserve context behind major tradeoffs.
- Reduce repeated debate on settled decisions.
- Improve onboarding for new contributors.

## How To Use

1. Copy `0000-template.md` to the next numbered filename.
2. Fill in context, decision, tradeoffs, and consequences.
3. Link related PRs/issues.
4. Update this index with the new ADR.

Naming convention:

- `0001-short-title.md`
- `0002-short-title.md`

## Status Values

- `proposed` - under discussion
- `accepted` - approved and in use
- `deprecated` - replaced by a newer decision
- `superseded` - explicitly replaced (include replacement ADR)

## ADR Index

- [0000 - Template](./0000-template.md)

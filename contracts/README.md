# Frontend Contract Types

This folder contains TypeScript interfaces for frontend consumption.

- `frontend-api.ts` mirrors documented payloads in `docs/API_CONTRACT.md`
- `tsconfig.json` enables strict type-checking for this contract artifact

Use these types directly in your React app, or copy them into your frontend
repo as a starting point.

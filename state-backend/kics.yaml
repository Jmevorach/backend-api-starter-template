  # KMS Key Policy Requirements

  # KMS Key With Vulnerable Policy
  # Root account access is the standard AWS pattern for KMS key policies.
  # Without this, the key becomes unmanageable if all IAM policies are removed.
  # See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html

  # IAM Policy Grants Full Permissions
  # In KMS key policies, "kms:*" on "Resource": "*" is required because:
  # 1. The "*" refers to the key itself (self-referential), not all resources
  # 2. The principal is restricted to the account root only
  # 3. This is AWS's documented default key policy pattern
